# Next.js 15 App Router - Link Component Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router where the `Link` component doesn't behave as expected, leading to incorrect routing.

## Bug Description

The provided code includes two `Link` components from `next/link`. When clicking on these links, the navigation does not work correctly, potentially resulting in a blank page or navigating to the wrong route.  This might manifest as the URL not changing, or an unexpected page loading.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the behavior of clicking the links.

## Potential Causes

This bug might stem from:

* Incorrect configuration of the App Router.
* Conflicting routing rules.
* Issues with the base path setting in the application.
* A version mismatch in dependencies

## Solution

The bug was solved by verifying the structure of the pages directory and ensuring no conflicting routes existed. In addition, the Next.js version and dependencies were checked for compatibility.  Further, the base path was verified to be correctly set for the application.
